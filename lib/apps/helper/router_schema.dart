/// [RouterSchema] is a model to implement all Mishka CMS app routes.
///
/// [id]: uniq id for each route.
///
/// [routeName]: must be a specific [SelectRoute] name for the current route.
///
/// [route]: in this callback, you get an [argument] that if you want to send
/// data from one router to another, you must pass this [argument] to a router
/// class. and finally you have to return a router(from template).
///
/// [blocProviderValue]: if your route is going to use bloc, we will put that
/// bloc in this section for the current route and your route will look like
/// this in the background:
/// ```dart
/// BlocProvider.value(
///   value: blocProviderValue,
///   child: route,
/// );
/// ```
///
/// > if u want to add new [bloc] or other statemanager libraries wrapper:
/// > 1. add a new optional param to [RouterSchema] just like `blocProviderValue`
/// > 2. read full documentation of [Routes]
